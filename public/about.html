<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hi, I'm Supriya: Data Science Student at Saint Peter's University</p>

I'm Supriya based in Paoli, Pennsylvania. I'm passionate about coding, and I love sharing my experiences and knowledge with others.
Growing up, I was always fascinated by java and web development. Being an Electronics student in my Batchelos I do have electives like
java and other Computer Science related courses.so, from there i understood my interest in it and after my under graduation I got an opportunity with infosys to learn and put my 
knowledge and from there the the journey begin.I am really happy about my decision of choosing the feild of my interests.</p>

<p>
Some of my proudest accomplishments include i got promotion from Systems Engineer Trainee to Systems Engineer and before I leave the company 
I promoted to Senior Systems Engineer. I'm especially proud of these because not staying there and working for them I learnt lot of things be it a knowledge 
be it a Team Work, and many more and I have a great team who is always supportive.</p>

<p>
  The Decision of my Master's was not pre planned, it was just few days decision. and I am here now in USA.
  And I took Data Science course because I would like to learn more about 
  AWS, Machine Learning and Artificial Intellegence. that made me take that course and its not like changing my current feild but
  adding extra knowledge to my current field which is some how connected and usefull.
